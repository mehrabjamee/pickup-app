                <p>Pickup, as of now, is an app that makes setting up pickup sports games in your neighborhood quick and easy. Just select a sport, 
                park, and time to play, and in no time, you will be off to the park for a nice game!<br><br>In the future, we hope to expand the app into other hobbies and interests
                , such as pickup chess games, and clubs and classes of any kind. We also hope to roll it out to larger and larger parts of the world, so people anywhere can organize group events.
                <br><br>With time, young people ages (whatever you chose your demographic to be) all around the world will be able to find and schedule pickup games effortlessly. 
                By making playing sports in kids' freetime easier and easier, Pickup can help build a healthier society with children and adolescents choosing to spend their days making friends and exercising, rather than staying at home. 
                <br> <br>Childhood obesity in the US has tripled since the 1970s with one-fifth of school age children affected. 
                By encouraging a more active society, Pickup can mitigate the effects of childhood obesity and promote a healthier America.</p>
